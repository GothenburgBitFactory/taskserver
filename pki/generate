# For a public or production server, purchase a cert from a known CA, and skip
# the next step.

# For development, testing and personal server management, create a CA key and
# cert, and use that to generate a server key and cert.  Creates:
#   ca.key.pem
#   ca.cert.pem
#   server.key.pem
#   server.cert.pem

./generate.ca
./generate.server

# Generate a certificate revocation list (CRL).  The initial CRL is empty, but
# can grow over time.  Creates:
#   server.crl.pem

./generate.crl

# The above is sufficient to operate a server.  What follows is a per-client
# process.  Creates:
#   ${1}.key.pem
#   ${1}.cert.pem

./generate.client api
