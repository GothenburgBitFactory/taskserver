Shell environment variables that affect how and what tests are executed:

TASKW_SKIP -> Causes any test that needs Taskwarrior (task binary only) to be skipped (TestCase)
TASKD_SKIP -> Causes any test that needs Task Server (taskd) to be skipped (ServerTestCase)

# NOTE: Tests that use both "task" and "taskd" (ServerTestCase) are not skipped when TASKW_SKIP is set.

TASK_USE_PATH -> Causes tests to look for "task" in PATH instead of the default location
TASKD_USE_PATH -> Causes tests to look for "taskd" in PATH instead of the default location
