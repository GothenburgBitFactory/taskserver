New Features in Taskserver 1.2.0

  - When the server specified is ::, can use dual-stack IPv4/IPv6.
  - New default 2048 bits for Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
  - Server-side cipher selection is now preferred, preventing the client from
    switching to less-secure communication.
  - Removed broken SSLv3 and TLSv1.0 ciphers (POODLE) from default.
  - Removed broken 3DES cipher in CBC mode from default.
  - Removed broken RC4 cipher from default.
  - Removed broken MD5 cipher from default.
  - Integrates libshared.
  - Made the documentation consistently distinguish between user name and UUID.

New configuration options in Taskserver 1.2.0

  - New 'dh_bits' setting allows an override to the 2048 bit default
    for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
  - Renamed 'client.cert' and 'client.key' to 'api.cert' and 'api.key', because
    the word 'client' implied it was to be used for all clients.

Removed features in 1.2.0

  - Removed the stubbed 'group' features.
