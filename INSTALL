Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Please follow the instructions below to build and install Taskserver from
source.


Pre-requisites
--------------

You will need the CMake build system installed in order to build taskwarrior
from source. More information on cmake can be obtained at http://cmake.org

You will also need:
  - make

You will need a C++ compiler that supports full C++11, which includes:
  - gcc 4.7   (released 2012-03-23)
  - clang 3.3 (released 2013-01-07)

You will need the following libraries:
  - libuuid
  - gnutls

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you build with a library that provides uuid_*
functions, such as libuuid.


Basic Installation
------------------

Briefly, these shell commands will unpack, build and install Taskserver:

  $ tar xzf taskd-X.Y.Z.tar.gz                  [1]
  $ cd taskd-X.Y.Z                              [2]
  $ cmake .                                     [3]
  $ make                                        [4]
  $ sudo make install                           [5]
  $ cd .. ; rm -r taskd-X.Y.Z                   [6]

These commands are explained below:

  1. Unpacks the source tarball.  This creates the directory taskd-X.Y.Z,
     containing all the code.

  2. Change directory to the root of the distribution.

  3. Invokes CMake to scan for dependencies and machine-specific details, then
     generate the makefiles.  This may take a minute.

  4. Builds Taskserver.  This may take a minute.

  5. Installs the program, documentation and other data files.

  6. Removes the temporary directory.


Build and configurations options
--------------------------------

You can customize the configuration run with cmake variables. This will modify
the installation process:

To change the installation directory you use the following configuration
variable:

  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path-to-installation-dir> .

cmake configuration variables are applied with the -D option and consist of a
<name> and a <value>:

  $ cmake -D<name>=<value> .

Four more variables can customize the installation process. The following table
lists them and their defaults plus the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX  /usr/local
  TASKD_BINDIR           bin
  TASKD_DOCDIR           share/doc/taskd
  TASKD_MAN1DIR          share/man/man1
  TASKD_MAN5DIR          share/man/man5

The corresponding TASKD_* variables will be combined with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
to get absolute installation directoris:

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASKD_BINDIR   /usr/local/bin
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASKD_DOCDIR   /usr/local/share/doc/taskd
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASKD_MAN1DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man1
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASKD_MAN5DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man5


Localizations
-------------

To make use of a translation, specify a language number, as found in cmake.h:

  $ cmake -DLANGUAGE=1 .

Currently the defined languages are:

  eng_USA 1


Uninstallation
--------------

There is no uninstall option in CMake makefiles. This ia a manual process.

To uninstall Taskserver, remove the files listed in the install_manifest.txt
file that was generated when you built Taskwarrior.


Taskserver Build Notes
----------------------

Taskserver has dependencies that are detected by cmake in almost all cases, but
there are situations and operating systems that mean you will need to offer a
little help.

If Taskserver will not build on your system, first take a look at the Operating
System notes below.  If this doesn't help, then go to the Troubleshooting
section, which includes instructions on how to contact us for help.


Operating System Notes
----------------------

None yet.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you've recently made changes to dependencies (by reinstalling them, for
example) be sure to rerun 'cmake .' before trying to execute 'make' again.

CMake will run and locate all the necessary pieces for the build, and create
a Makefile.  There may be errors and warnings when running CMake, or there
may be compiler errors and warnings when running 'make'.  Sometimes you will run
CMake with no reported problems, and the build will fail later.  This is
almost always because CMake is mistaken about some assumption.

If a build does not succeed, please send the contents of the 'CMakeCache.txt' 
and 'CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log' files to support@taskwarrior.org, or post a
message in the support forums at taskwarrior.org along with the information.

If CMake runs but Taskserver does not build, please send the contents of the
above files as well as a transcript from the build, which is not written to a
file and must be captured from the terminal.
