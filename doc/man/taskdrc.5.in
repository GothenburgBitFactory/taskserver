.SH NAME
taskdrc \- Configuration details for the taskd(1) server

.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

Valid variable names and their default values are:

.TP
.B ca.cert=/path/to/ca.cert.pem
Fully qualified path to the CA certificate.  Optional.

.TP
.B ciphers=%SERVER_PRECEDENCE:NORMAL
List of GnuTLS ciphers to use.  Default is "%SERVER_PRECEDENCE:NORMAL" as well
as turning off known-to-be-broken configurations known-broken (namely SSLv3,
TLSv1.0, 3DES-CBC, RC4, and MD5).  See your GnuTLS documentation for full
details.

.TP
.B dh_bits
Size of the Diffie-Hellman parameters. Default is GnuTLS-specified. See your
GnuTLS documentation for full details.

.TP
.B confirmation=on
Determines whether certain commands are confirmed.  Defaults to on.

.TP
.B api.cert=/path/to/api.cert.pem
Fully qualified path of the api cert.  This is used by the 'api' command.
This is an optional value, you will not likely need this.

.TP
.B debug=off
Logs debugging information.

.TP
.B debug.tls=0
GnuTLS log level, an integer from 0 to 9, where 0 means no logging, and 9
means sensitive data leaks.  Caution!

.TP
.B extensions=<path>
Fully qualified path of the Taskserver extension scripts.  Currently there are
none.

.TP
.B family=IPv4
Specifies the address family to use.  Can be 'IPv4', 'IPv6', or not specified
which means 'any'.  Default is no value.

.TP
.B ip.log=on
Logs the IP addresses of incoming requests.

.TP
.B log=/tmp/taskd.log
Fully-qualified path name to the Taskserver log file.  Alternately, specifying
the value '-' will cause all logging to go to STDOUT.  This does not apply when
the server is run as a daemon.

.TP
.B pid.file=/tmp/taskd.pid
Fully-qualified path name to the Taskserver PID file.  This is used by
the 'taskdctl' script to start/stop the daemon.

.TP
.B queue.size=10
Size of the connection backlog.  See 'man listen'.

.TP
.B request.limit=4194304
Size limit of incoming requests, in bytes.  Use a value of zero '0' to indicate
no size limit. For large task lists, this 4MB value may be too small.

.TP
.B server=localhost:53589
The address (IPv4, IPv6 or DNS) of the Taskserver, followed by a colon and the
port number.

.TP
.B server.proxy=on
Offloads SSL connection handling to a reverse proxy.  Connections are accepted
unencrypted and wrapped with PROXYv2 protocol.

This is appropriate for service behind haproxy configured with
"send-proxy-v2" server option or behind stunnel with "protocol = proxy".
Optional SSL information is ignored.

Defaults to off.

.TP
.B server.cert=/path/to/server.cert.pem
Fully qualified path to the server certificate.

.TP
.B server.crl=/path/to/server.crl.pem
Fully qualified path to the server certificate revocation list.

.TP
.B server.key=/path/to/server.key.pem
Fully qualified path to the server key.

.TP
.B trust=strict
Trust level of the server, which determines how the client certificates are
verified.
If the value is 'strict' then the certificate is validated.
If the value is 'allow all' then no validation is performed.

Note that sending the HUP signal to the Taskserver causes a configuration
file reload before the next request is handled.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Environment variables provide values that would otherwise be required at the
command line.

.TP
.B TASKDDATA=<root>
Most command require either '\-\-data <root>' or this environment variable.  If
both are provided, the command line overrides the environment.
