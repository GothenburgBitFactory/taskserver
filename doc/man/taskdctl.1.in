.SH NAME
taskdctl \- Taskserver control program

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B taskdctl [start|stop|restart|graceful|status]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The taskdctl program allows you to start and stop Taskserver. The TASKDDATA
environment variable is used to locate the root data structure, and query the
configuration to obtain the location of the pid file.

.SH COMMANDS
Taskdctl supports several commands:

.TP
.B taskdctl start
Starts the server as a daemon, if it is not already running.
It is harmless to run this command if the server is already running.

.TP
.B taskdctl stop
Stops the server, if it is running.
It is harmless to run this command if the server is not running.

.TP
.B taskdctl restart
Stops the server, if it is running, then starts the server again.
This is done by killing the server process.
This will interrupt any current sync sessions, probably causing an error.
It is harmless to run this command if the server is not running.

.TP
.B taskdctl graceful
Stops the server, if it is running, by waiting for the server to go idle, then
restarts the server again.
This is done by sending SIGHUP signal to the server.
This will not interrupt any current sync sessions.
It is harmless to run this command if the server is not running.

.TP
.B taskdctl status
Shows the status of the Taskserver, whether it is running or not.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Taskdctl requires that the TAKSDDATA environment variable be properly set. This
is because the root data structure is accessed.
